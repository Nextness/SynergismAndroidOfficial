# Synergism - the game for Android

This is a in-development version of [Synergism](https://github.com/Pseudo-Corp/SynergismOfficial) for mobile devices with Android OS.

# Other information

For the development of the Android version, the Kotlin programming language is utilized. A lot of the original code, game loop and game experience need to be re-evaluated while porting it to a mobile version.

A [re-design of the User Experience](https://www.figma.com/file/xxpq7xXX4MG7Ym9Zo2jK57/Synergism-Discovery?type=design&node-id=353%3A192&mode=design&t=6rjCVGHOk0yyGeqi-1) to accommodate for the mobile version is in-progress, and the interface is bound to change during development. Additionally, the software architecture needs to be re-evaluated to fit Kotlin programming language.
